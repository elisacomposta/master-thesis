\section*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Francesco Pierri, together with Nicol√≤ Fontana and Francesco Corso, for guiding me through this work and for supporting me in every phase of the project, while encouraging me to explore and express my ideas.

\smallskip
I am sincerely grateful to my family, who have always supported me throughout every step of my journey, believed in me, and stood by every decision I made, even when it meant being apart.

\smallskip
A warm thank to Simone for standing by my side in every moment, and for being always ready to follow me wherever my dreams may take me.

\smallskip
I also want to thank my university friends, with whom sharing classes and exams became a little lighter, in particular Francesco, Giovanni, Matteo, and Riccardo.

\smallskip
Finally, I'm grateful to the people I met during my experiences outside the university, for helping me appreciate the value of genuine dedication and for teaching me that even the smallest details can contribute to the greatest things.
