% General context
In the last years, online social networks have gradually become fundamental part of everyday life of millions of people.
They are no longer just platforms for communication, but real digital spaces where users express their emotions and shape their opinions and behaviors.
This makes them an interesting mean not only for studying individual dynamics in online interactions, but also for exploring complex collective phenomena, such as polarization, content diffusion, and other social processes.

One powerful way to investigate these dynamics is through the use of simulators.
These tools make it possible to recreate controlled virtual environments where it's possible to test specific scenarios, compare different strategies and observe the evolution of the behavior of users, even under conditions that would be difficult, or ethically problematic, to reproduce in real world.
For instance, it's possible to analyze the impact of the diffusion of toxic content or fake news, or evaluate how different recommendation algorithms influence user behavior, without the need to interfere with real platforms.

However, building a realistic simulation of a social network is a complex challenge.
The behaviors that emerge from these systems are shaped by of many individual human factors, which are often hard to predict or formalize.
The human nature of interactions introduces variability, ambiguity, and contextual information, making the development of such systems particularly difficult.
