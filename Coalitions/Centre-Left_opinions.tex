\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Civil rights}:
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE] Support for equal marriage and adoption rights for same-sex couples, anti-homotransphobia laws, and recognition of LGBTQIA+ rights. 
        \end{tcolorbox}

    \item \textbf{Immigration}:
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [SUPPORTIVE] Policies of reception and inclusion are needed, aiming to facilitate integration pathways, guarantee migrants' rights, and build a European immigration management system based on solidarity among member states. Humanitarian corridors should be expanded for emergency situations.
        \end{tcolorbox}
        
    \item \textbf{Nuclear energy}: 
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [STRONGLY OPPOSED] The ecological transition must prioritize renewables and energy efficiency; nuclear power is considered too expensive, slow to implement, and incompatible with the urgent need to reduce emissions by 2030, while also raising unresolved environmental concerns.
        \end{tcolorbox}
    
    \item \textbf{Reddito di cittadinanza}
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [SUPPORTIVE] The current system shouldn't be abolished, but we should address distortions. Proposals include recalibrating the benefit, introducing support for large families, a minimum wage, mandating pay for curricular internships, and abolishing unpaid extracurricular internships.
