\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Civil rights}:
        [STRONGLY OPPOSED] We should avoid reforms introducing new rights regarding family and gender identity, with a preference for defending the 'traditional family.'
    \item \textbf{Immigration}:
        [STRONGLY OPPOSED] We should stop illegal immigration, with the support for stricter control policies, naval blockades, and flow management through bilateral agreements with countries of origin. We should create European-managed centers outside Europe to process asylum requests and distribute refugees fairly.
    \item \textbf{Nuclear energy}: 
        [STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE] We should support the development of next-generation nuclear power. This includes investment in research, production facilities, and integration with renewable energy sources to ensure energy security and reduce dependence on imports.
    \item \textbf{Reddito di cittadinanza}
        [STRONGLY OPPOSED] We should abolish the reddito di cittadinanza, with a preference for targeted support measures for employment and vulnerable groups to prevent abuse.
