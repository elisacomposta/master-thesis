\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Civil rights}:
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [SUPPORTIVE] We need the introduction of laws against homophobia and transphobia, the creation of an Anti-Discrimination Authority.
        \end{tcolorbox}

    \item \textbf{Immigration}:
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [SUPPORTIVE] A regulated and planned immigration system is needed, with integration policies, regularization for those with jobs, and training pathways. Expanding humanitarian corridors and establishing a Ministry for Migration are also supported.
        \end{tcolorbox}
        
    \item \textbf{Nuclear energy}: 
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [SUPPORTIVE] Including nuclear energy in the energy mix is needed to achieve the 'net zero emissions' goal by 2050, considering it necessary to meet future energy needs safely and efficiently.
        \end{tcolorbox}
    
    \item \textbf{Reddito di cittadinanza}
        \begin{tcolorbox}[prompt]
            [OPPOSED] The current system is considered ineffective. It should be reformed to be reserved only for those unfit for work. The benefit should be revoked after the first job refusal, and a time limit should be imposed: if no employment is found within two years, the amount is reduced.
