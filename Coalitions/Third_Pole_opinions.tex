\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Civil rights}:
        [SUPPORTIVE] We need the introduction of laws against homophobia and transphobia, the creation of an Anti-Discrimination Authority.
    \item \textbf{Immigration}:
        [SUPPORTIVE] A regulated and planned immigration system is needed, with integration policies, regularization for those with jobs, and training pathways. Expanding humanitarian corridors and establishing a Ministry for Migration are also supported.       
    \item \textbf{Nuclear energy}: 
        [SUPPORTIVE] Including nuclear energy in the energy mix is needed to achieve the 'net zero emissions' goal by 2050, considering it necessary to meet future energy needs safely and efficiently.    
    \item \textbf{Reddito di cittadinanza}
        [OPPOSED] The current system is considered ineffective. It should be reformed to be reserved only for those unfit for work. The benefit should be revoked after the first job refusal, and a time limit should be imposed: if no employment is found within two years, the amount is reduced.
