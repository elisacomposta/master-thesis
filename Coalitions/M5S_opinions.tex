\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Civil rights}:
        [STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE] Support for equal marriage, anti-homotransphobia legislation.
    \item \textbf{Immigration}:
        [SUPPORTIVE] A humanitarian approach is needed, with integration policies and mandatory redistribution of migrants across Europe.        
    \item \textbf{Nuclear energy}: 
        [STRONGLY OPPOSED] Nuclear energy has high costs and safety risks. We should focus on a decentralized energy model that encourages self-production and local energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Reddito di cittadinanza}
        [STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE] The reddito di cittadinanza is strongly defended, with proposals to enhance the efficiency of active labor policies and implement antifraud monitoring mechanisms.
